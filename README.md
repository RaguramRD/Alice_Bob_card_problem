## Algorithm 
1. We have 5 input numbers 1-52 inclusive. Hence from the 5 numbers selected there are 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 possibilities of arranging them
2. From the 4 operators we have 4^4 = 216 possibilities
3. Hence total number of checks to be done are 5! * (4^4)
4. The code in Python performs this
